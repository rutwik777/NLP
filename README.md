### What is NLP?  

Letâ€™s get to know what Natural Language Processing is. Right now, as we are reading and writing this report,
we our brain is actually forming some sort of comprehension from it. When we program a computer do it, it is 
known as Natural Language Processing. Natural Language Processing is a very useful in all sorts of textual 
based AI applications. NLP starts with unstructured text, which is how we speak and interpret text. For example, 
some unstructured text is "add cheese and bread to my grocery list." Now we understand exactly what that 
means, but it is unstructured to a computer. So, what we proceed to do, is to create a structured representation of 
that same information that a computer can process. Now list of groceries can be considered as a big list and then 
it has elements within it, like cheese, and bread. Now this is a structured list. The job of natural language 
processing is to translate between unstructured and structured data sitting right in the middle.
