## 1.1 What is NLP?  

Let’s get to know what Natural Language Processing is. Right now, as we are reading and writing this report,
we our brain is actually forming some sort of comprehension from it. When we program a computer do it, it is 
known as Natural Language Processing. Natural Language Processing is a very useful in all sorts of textual 
based AI applications. NLP starts with unstructured text, which is how we speak and interpret text. For example, 
some unstructured text is "add cheese and bread to my grocery list." Now we understand exactly what that 
means, but it is unstructured to a computer. So, what we proceed to do, is to create a structured representation of 
that same information that a computer can process. Now list of groceries can be considered as a big list and then 
it has elements within it, like cheese, and bread. Now this is a structured list. The job of natural language 
processing is to translate between unstructured and structured data sitting right in the middle.

Natural Language Processing is used in various Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications to 
derive insights from textual data. Corporations, scientists, and governments use it across the world to understand 
user behaviour, sentiments, opinion and much more. Let’s go through the tasks that can be accomplished by 
Natural Language Processing. These include language translation, similar sentence identification, paragraph 
summarization, text classification (e.g., spam message filtering), sentiment analysis (e.g., Positive, Neutral or 
Negative user feeling), question answering, conversational agents and chatbots.

## 1.2 Bag of Words  

As we have seen earlier computers can’t understand language like we do. Computers understand numbers, more 
specifically into vectors. Bag of words is one of the ways to achieve this. So basically, bag of words is way to 
represent some text mathematically for modelling a machine learning algorithm. It’s based on the concept 
that if two sentences have matching words then they are similar. Bag of words is modelled after 2 things.
  1. Generate a vocabulary of all the words and characters in the entire corpus of given sentences.
  2. Measure which words are present in which sentences by creating a vector.  
  
Bag of words is usually combined with techniques of Lemmatisation or stemming after removing stop words 
from the sentences to get final vector representation. The downside of this technique is that it does not take into 
regard into order or structure which could reveal more meaningful information about the sentences.
